Engagement_Score Prediction

The  following case study represents the engagement score prediction for the online videos created and users watched them and on the basis of this the engagement score of the past data is used to train the model.

First of all I used:-
Data Processing
Feature Engineering
Model Development based on different ML models used
Based on the developed model I used hyperparameter tuning to tune the models and increasing the score of the model 
Based on the Model score I choose the model which suits the best.
